## What is a static website?

A static website is a website that is served to the user exactly as stored. This means that the website is not dynamic and does not change based on user input. There are no databases or server-side processing involved, such as authentication or user input validation. A good example of a static website is a blog, portfolio website, or even a project website.

## how to create a static website?

To create a static website all you need is a simple HTML file, optionally you can add CSS and JavaScript to make it look better. But the main idea is to have a simple HTML file that can be served to the user.
Crafting a static website with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be very cumbersome and time-consuming. This is where static site generators come in. Static site generators are tools that help you create static websites by generating HTML files from templates and content files. Some popular static site generators are as follows:

- Jekyll
- Hugo
- Gatsby
- Next.js
