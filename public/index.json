[{"content":" The Basics The following code snippets are useful for creating custom installers and uninstallers in Powershell. The advantage to creating script installers versus uploading a regular exe or msi is that a script installer allows for fine-grained control over the installation process. This is especially useful when dealing with porly written installers.\nAt the end of this article, I will provide an exaple of a full script that can be used to install/uninstall a program.\nSnippets Automagically Uninstall Programs # Retrieve uninstall information from the registry $programsToUninstall = Get-ChildItem -Path HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall, HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall | # Extract properties of each registry key Get-ItemProperty | # Filter to only include items where the DisplayName matches \u0026#34;Program Name\u0026#34; Where-Object { ($_.DisplayName -match \u0026#34;Program Name\u0026#34;)} | # Select the UninstallString and DisplayName for further processing Select-Object UninstallString, DisplayName This script will search the registry for installed programs that have a displayname that matches \u0026ldquo;Program Name\u0026rdquo; and return the uninstall string and display name for each program into the $programsToUninstall array. There is a few ways that we can expand this script to be more useful. For example,\nAdding a foreach loop to modify the uninstall string to include the /quiet or -s flag (depending on the program that we are unisntalling). This will allow us to silently uninstall the program. Add more Select-Object properties to the script to include the displayVersion of the program. This will allow us to create fine-grained uninstall scripts that can target specific versions of a program. Additionally, we can use this information to add to a custom log file. Error Handling When Calling External Programs try { # Running the msiexec program with example parameters $processInfo = Start-Process msiexec.exe -ArgumentList \u0026#34;/i C:\\Path\\To\\Your\\Installer.msi /quiet /norestart\u0026#34; -Wait -PassThru # Checking the exit code of the process if ($processInfo.ExitCode -eq 0) { Write-Host \u0026#34;Installation succeeded without requiring a reboot.\u0026#34; } elseif ($processInfo.ExitCode -eq 3010) { Write-Host \u0026#34;Installation succeeded but a reboot is required.\u0026#34; # Restart-Computer (restart the computer now) # $restart = $true (restart the computer later and using the $restart variable) } else { throw \u0026#34;Installation failed with exit code $($processInfo.ExitCode).\u0026#34; } } catch { # If an exception is thrown in the try block, it\u0026#39;s caught here. Write-Host \u0026#34;An error occurred: $_\u0026#34; # Additional error handling can be performed here if needed. } The key takeaway from this script is the use of the try and catch blocks. The try block will attempt to run the code within the block. If an error occurs, the catch block will catch the error and run the code within the block. This is useful when calling external programs that may not return a 0 exit code when they run successfully. For example, the msiexec program will return a 0 exit code when it runs successfully, but it may return a 3010 exit code if a reboot is required. By using the try and catch blocks, we can catch the 3010 exit code and handle it accordingly.\nCommand Line Arguments param ( [string]$silent, [string]$uninstall ) Command line arguments can be passed to a Powershell script by using the param block at the beginning of the script. This block allows you to define the parameters that the script will accept. In this example, the script accepts two parameters: $silent and $uninstall. These parameters can be passed to the script when it is run from the command line. For example, .\\script.ps1 -silent \u0026quot;true\u0026quot; -uninstall \u0026quot;true\u0026quot;.\nFull Example ","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/sccm_powershell/","summary":"The Basics The following code snippets are useful for creating custom installers and uninstallers in Powershell.
